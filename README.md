webappmanager
=============

Summary
-------
webOS ports web application management daemon

Description
-----------
This is the web application launcher for the Luna Next webOS UI platform. In difference to
the tradional approach of having a webappmanager component we're intending to launch every
application in it's own process by using WebKit2.
